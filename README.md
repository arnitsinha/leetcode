## Introduction

LeetCode is a platform for practicing coding interviews. It offers a vast collection of problems categorized by difficulty level and topic. This repository serves as a record of my solutions to these problems.

## Solutions

The solutions are organized by problem name and number. Each solution is provided in a separate Python file with a class implementing the solution. The file name corresponds to the problem's title on LeetCode.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arnitsinha/leetcode-solutions.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the solution you want to explore:

   ```bash
   cd leetcode-solutions
   ```

3. Open the solution file using a text editor or an IDE of your choice.

4. Read through the solution code and comments to understand the approach and implementation.

5. Run the solution code to test it with different inputs or modify it as needed.

## Contributing
